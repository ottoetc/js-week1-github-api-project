# _Github Repo Lister_

#### _Look up a Github user and see their public repos, 3/21/2016_

#### By _**Nathan Otto**_

## Description

_This application allows the user to enter a github user name and get a list of all public repositories for that user listed out by name with descriptions if available_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone or download the repo_
* _Create a .env file and add your own Github API key to it_
* _Navigate to the project directory and run `node install` and `bower install`_
* _Now in terminal run `gulp build` or `gulp build --production`_
* _Now in terminal run `gulp serve` to launch a local development server to host the app._

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_
